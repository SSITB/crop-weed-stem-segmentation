# Crop, Weed and Stem Segmentation Project
Identifying weed plants in cultivated filed is a time-intensive task. Automating such a task can drastically reduce the time needed to identify and remove weeds and thus increase the yield and the productivity of the workers. In our latest project, we worked on a plant segmentation task that uses Deep Learning to identify weeds and their stems from crops. <br>
